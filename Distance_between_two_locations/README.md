# Distance between two locations

This project demonstrates how to calculate the distance between two geographic locations on Earth using the Haversine Formula. The formula is widely used in navigation and mapping applications to determine the shortest distance between two points on a sphere, given their latitude and longitude coordinates. It accounts for the curvature of the Earth, making it more accurate than using simple Euclidean geometry.
