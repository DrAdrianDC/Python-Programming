# Letter Count and Index

This Python script counts the occurrences of letters in a string and returns their respective indices. It can be an insightful tool for various applications. For example, this functionality is useful in cryptography, text analysis, natural language processing, and even data compression algorithms where understanding the frequency and position of characters is crucial.


## Features

 -  **Count Occurrences:** Counts how many times a specified letter appears in a given word.
 -  **Find Index:** Finds the first index (position) of the specified letter in the word. If the letter is not found, it returns a message indicating that.

## Usage

 1-  Run the script.
 
 2-  Enter a word when prompted.
 
 3-  Enter the letter you wish to either count or find.
 
 4-  Choose the action: count or index.


The script will return the result based on your input:

- If you choose count, it will show how many times the letter appears in the word.
- If you choose index, it will return the position of the first occurrence of the letter (or a message if the letter is not found).
