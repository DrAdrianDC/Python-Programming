## Bayesian Optimization

This project demonstrates how to use **Bayesian Optimization** (via `scikit-optimize`) to find the minimum of a simple two-variable function. The optimization is performed using **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** as a surrogate model, which efficiently balances exploration and exploitation to locate the global minimum with minimal function evaluations.
