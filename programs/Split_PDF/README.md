## Split a PDF

### How to use it

Consider that you want to split a PDF in two parts, the first one from page 1 to 140 , and the second from 142 to the end
(If you type 141, the script takes pages at index 0 through 140. This equals 141 total pages.)


1- Place the PDF: Put your PDF file (e.g., my_book.pdf) in the same folder as this script.

2- Run the script: Run python split_pdf.py in your terminal.

3- Follow the prompts:

Input Name: Type my_book.pdf.

Split Page: Type 141.
