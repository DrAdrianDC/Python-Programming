## Neural network using 10 lines in Python 

In just 10 lines of Python code you can create and train a neural network model that classify handwritten digits.


(Consider that the present code is only a sample, an for a real-world applications needs more development.)

## Features

   - **Dataset**: MNIST handwritten digits.
   - **Architecture**: Simple neural network with:
        **One hidden layer** (10 neurons, **tanh activation**).
        **Output layer** with **softmax activation** for classification.
   - **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
   - **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy.


## How to Run

```bash
python neural_network_in_10_lines_of_code.py
```
