## Trapezoidal Rule

This folder contains a Python implementation of the Trapezoidal Rule. This numerical method for approximating the definite integral of a function it is used in varoius fields to estimate integrals with a reasonable degree of accuracy and computational efficiency.

#### How it works
The Trapezoidal Rule estimates the integral by dividing the area under the curve into trapezoids, calculating the area of each trapezoid, and summing these areas to obtain the approximation.
