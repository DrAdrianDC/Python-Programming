# QR Code Generation with Python

This project allows users to generate a QR code from any given link using Python. The QR code is saved as a PNG file and can be displayed immediately.

## Overview

QR code generation in Python is an essential tool for efficiently sharing information in a compact and scannable format. By using Python, developers can easily create QR codes for diverse applications, from sharing URLs, contact information, and Wi-Fi credentials to embedding complex data in a single image. The simplicity of generating QR codes programmatically allows businesses, developers, and users to streamline access to digital resources, improve user experience, etc. This makes QR code generation an invaluable feature in modern applications, where quick and direct access to information is crucial.
