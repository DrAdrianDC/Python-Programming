# Weather Scraper


## Overview

This Python script allows users to get the current weather data for any city by scraping the weather information from the Time and Date website (https://www.timeanddate.com/). It takes the city and country as input, constructs the URL based on these inputs, and then retrieves the current temperature and weather condition of the specified city.
