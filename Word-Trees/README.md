# Word Trees using Python

This repository contains a Python script that generates a word cloud visualization from user-provided text. Word clouds are a popular way to visualize the frequency of words in a text, where more frequently occurring words appear larger than others. In practice, word trees serve as effective visual aids in presentations, helping to emphasize key points and engage the audience.

## Features

- Customizable appearance with options for size, background color, and color palette.
- Saves the generated word cloud image in high resolution.

## Requirements

To run this code, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `matplotlib`
- `wordcloud`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib wordcloud
